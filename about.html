    <h2>Meta-Journalism is a site where you enter keywords, and determine the supply vs. demand for articles on a topic. </h2>

    <br><b>Social Media Score</b>
<br><t>Derived based on the frequency of new tweets being sent out featuring the keywords
<br><t>Used to scale the potential popularity of a topic based on expected reader engagement.
<br><br><b>Press Coverage Score</b>
<br><t>Derived based on how many news stories mention the keywords, weighted by frequency of publication.
<br><t>Used to measure the current supply of news stories on a topic.
<br><br><b>Search Popularity Score</b>
<br><t>Derived based on the data supplied by Google Trends on search popularity.
<br><t>Used to measure the current demand for news stories on a topic.
<br><br><b>M-Score</b>
<br><t>Our cumulative score, taking all of the above into account.
<br><t>The larger the M-Score, the more opportunity there is for articles to be posted on the subject.
<br><t>Smaller, or negative M-Scores imply oversaturation of stories in the market, thus less opportunities for articles on that subject.
<br><t>M-Scores less than 5 probabably aren't worth writing about.
